There are 6 Scripts written in Python 3.8 in this folder. They are as follows:
1) Frequency_of_SSR_calculate.py: Program to calculate the total no of SSRs, no of SSR motifs and frequency of SSR
2) Program_to_identify_common_SSR_group_motifs_between_query_reference_genome_in_default_special_mode.py : program to identify common Group SSR motifs between query and reference genomes
3) SSR_CDS_overlap.py: Program to calculate the total frequency of trinucleotide SSR motifs present in the coding region (CDS) of a particular gene
4) Unique_group_SSR_motif_identify_between_Query_and_reference_genome_in_default_special.py: Program to identify unique Group SSR motifs between query and reference genomes. 
5) calculate_ssr_length_density_gc_percentage_coverage_of_multiple_ssrFile_at_one_go_using_csv_input_write_into_csv.py :  Script to calculate SSR Length, SSR Density, GC Percentage of SSR, SSR Coverage 
6) ssr_mean.py: script to find the mean values of SSR regions of all the organisms
